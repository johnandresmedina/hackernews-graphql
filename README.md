# hackernews-graphql

The stack used was based on Node.js, graphql-yoga and Prisma.

graphql-yoga is a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of Express.js. It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for GraphQL Playgrounds and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.

The resolvers of your GraphQL server are implemented using Prisma Client which is responsible for database access.
